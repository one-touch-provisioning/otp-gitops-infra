# Catalog of Infrastructure Resources

This repository provides a curated library of infrastructure-related and cluster-wide resources for the [One Touch Provisioning](https://github.com/one-touch-provisioning/otp-gitops) project. These resources are delivered as plain YAML manifests or as Helm charts, making them easy to reference and deploy using ArgoCD Applications.

Helm charts from this repository are hosted in the [Cloud Native Toolkit Helm Repository](https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/toolkit-charts).

Use this repository to:
- Discover reusable infrastructure components for your clusters
- Reference and deploy resources via ArgoCD
- Contribute new or updated infrastructure assets for the One Touch Provisioning ecosystem
